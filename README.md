# 🚀 SecureFace Attendance System

**Next-Gen Face Recognition Attendance with Advanced Anti-Spoofing**

---

## 🛡️ Overview

SecureFace is an AI-powered attendance system designed to **eliminate proxy attendance and spoofing attacks**. Unlike traditional face recognition systems, SecureFace leverages state-of-the-art anti-spoofing models to detect and block both passive (photos, videos) and active (deepfakes, masks) attempts to fake attendance.

## ⚡ Current Status

> **🚧 Phase 1: Core Model Development Complete!**
> - ✅ Face detection and anti-spoofing model built and tested
> - ⏳ Front-end (mobile/web app) under active development
> - 🔗 Firebase integration planned for seamless real-time data sync
